  <h1 style="text-align: center;">Why Homework Shouldn't Be Required</h2>
  <br>
  <p>Homework, while being helpful, can also be a chore. Homework has effectively kept most of us up at night during the most overwhelming days, making us value practice work (which homework is widely considered as "practice") over our sleep, an important factor in our everyday lives. Educational facilities have let homework, something that is intended to make you better at a subject, instead withhold our mental capacity in some circumstances. What is the benefit, and the disadvantages of homework?

<strong>Benefits</strong>
<br>
<br>
  Doing a manageable amount of homework can and will mostly increase a human’s knowledge and understanding of a subject. Duke University researchers carried out a study in 2006, titled “Review of Educational Research.” The paper cites this conclusion:
<br><br>
“With only rare exception, the relationship between the amount of homework students do and their achievement outcomes was found to be positive and statistically significant."
<br><br>
  This research suggests that homework is significantly helpful in studies and benefits the knowledge of the children completing the homework.
<br><br>
<strong>Disadvantages</strong>
<br><br>
  On the other side of this case, we have the disadvantages of homework. Time spent doing homework in educational institutions has “greatly increased” among children/adolescents. Students attempting homework all have different lifestyles, scenarios, and environments. All of these factors can affect where students can complete homework in a timely manner and benefit from it.
<br><br>
  This increase in the amount of time required to complete homework has not been positively correlated with knowledge in the subject. In multiple studies, too much homework has a negative correlation to academic performance, and overall has a negative effect on a student’s attitude and behavior.
<br><br>
“In 2013, research conducted at Stanford University found that students in high-achieving communities who spend too much time on homework experience more stress, physical health problems, a lack of balance in their lives, and alienation from society.”
<br><br>
  There have been multiple studies strongly suggesting that excessive homework among students, especially middle school and high school students, has a negative effect on the students’ mental health, and can cause negative effects on the rest of the student’s family.
Another problem with homework is that there is no clear limit to what is considered “excessive homework.” Some countries have different social norms on homework, which therefore creates an imbalance between worldwide students’ homework levels. The National PTA and the NEA recommend:
<br><br>
“Most educators agree that for children in grades K-2, homework is more effective when it does not exceed 10-20 minutes each day; older children, in grades 3-6, can handle 30-60 minutes a day; in junior and senior high, the amount of homework will vary by subject….”
<br><br>
  Notice how it has no set guideline for Junior/Senior high school. This is due to the varying flexibility in each student, and each subject. At an elder age, there are more responsibilities, which leaves significantly less time for homework, while getting piled with more homework. This will easily overwhelm a student and will result in varying issues mentioned above. A Duke University research analysis concludes:
<br><br>
“These recommendations are consistent with the conclusions reached by our analysis. Practice assignments do improve scores on class tests at all grade levels. A little amount of homework may help elementary school students build study habits. Homework for junior high students appears to reach the point of diminishing returns after about 90 minutes a night. For high school students, the positive line continues to climb until between 90 minutes and 2½ hours of homework a night, after which returns diminish.”
<br><br><br>
  This suggests that homework given to students, especially elder students, needs to be significantly controlled. Flexibility for homework is required for students to keep learning and improve academic performance, and help students in the future.
<br>
Some researchers believe that the ten-minute rule (10 minutes of homework starting in 1st grade, increasing by 10 minutes per grade, ending at 2 hours for seniors) is the best option. There are others that feel as if the ten-minute rule is outdated, and there is a large curve between elementary and junior high, and each grade should be individually studied, along with subjects, and be determined what a good balance would be.
